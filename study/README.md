## üéØ Quick Start Guide

To understand this project:

1. **Start with Architecture**: Read [`project-architecture.md`](./project-architecture.md) to understand the overall system design and data flow
2. **Deep Dive into Modules**: Use [`modules-reference.md`](./modules-reference.md) as a reference while exploring the codebase
3. **Test the System**: Use the provided test scripts to interact with deployed agents

## üèóÔ∏è System Summary

This project demonstrates:

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: A central purchasing agent coordinates with specialized seller agents
- **A2A Protocol**: Standardized agent-to-agent communication 
- **Hybrid AI Frameworks**: LangGraph (ReAct pattern) + CrewAI (multi-agent) + ADK (orchestration)
- **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Google Cloud Run + Vertex AI Agent Engine
- **Modern UI**: Gradio-based chat interface with streaming responses

## üîç Key Insights

### Architecture Patterns
- **Hub-and-Spoke**: Central orchestrator with distributed specialized agents
- **Protocol-Driven**: A2A enables standardized inter-agent communication
- **Framework Diversity**: Different AI frameworks for different use cases
- **Cloud-First**: Designed for scalable cloud deployment

### Code Patterns  
- **Executor Pattern**: A2A executors bridge protocol and agent logic
- **Tool-Driven**: Structured tools for agent capabilities
- **Async Communication**: Non-blocking agent interactions
- **Configuration-Based**: Environment-driven agent discovery and connection

### Technologies Integration
- **ADK + A2A**: Google's agent framework with communication protocol
- **LangGraph**: Stateful conversation flows with memory
- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent task orchestration  
- **Vertex AI**: Managed LLM backend (Gemini)
- **Cloud Run**: Containerized microservice deployment

## üö® Known Issues

1. **Job Agent Misconfiguration**: Contains pizza logic instead of job-specific functionality
2. **Tool Naming Inconsistency**: Job agent uses pizza ordering tools
3. **Language Mismatch**: Korean job agent context with pizza English content

## üß™ Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing capabilities:
- **Local Testing**: ADK web UI for development
- **Cloud Testing**: A2A client scripts for deployed services
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end flow via Gradio UI

## üìö Learning Outcomes
