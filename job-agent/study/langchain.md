# Introduction to LangChain and LangGraph

LangChain and LangGraph are frameworks for building applications with large language models (LLMs).

## LangChain

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.

## LangGraph

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends the LangChain expression language with the ability to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a cyclic way.

## Key Differences

-   **Workflows**: LangChain is best for linear, sequential workflows, while LangGraph is designed for more complex, non-linear processes with loops and branching.
-   **State Management**: LangGraph provides explicit state management, which is useful for building complex, stateful applications.
