# Getting Started with Google Cloud AI Platform

Google Cloud AI Platform (now part of Vertex AI) is a suite of cloud-based tools and services for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models.

## Key Components

-   **Vertex AI Workbench**: An interactive, Jupyter notebook-based environment for data exploration, analysis, and model development.
-   **AutoML**: Allows you to train high-quality, custom models with minimal coding.
-   **Custom Training**: Provides full control for experienced ML engineers to train models using popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn.
-   **Generative AI Studio**: A tool for designing, testing, and tuning prompts for Google's large language models, like Gemini.

## Getting Started

1.  **Set Up Your Google Cloud Environment**: Create a Google Cloud account and a new project, and enable the Vertex AI API.

2.  **Choose Your Path**: Depending on your needs and expertise, you can use AutoML for a low-code approach, or Vertex AI Workbench for a code-based workflow.

3.  **"Hello AI" with Python and the Gemini API**: You can interact with Google's Gemini model from your local machine by installing the `google-cloud-aiplatform` library and writing a simple Python script.
